Developed and optimized logistic regression and random forest models using R to predict loan default probabilities and improve credit risk assessment. Through financial data analysis, identified key predictors such as home ownership, loan purpose, interest rate, income percentage, and credit history length, which significantly impact default risk. Additionally, challenged traditional risk models by discovering that prior defaults are a weak predictor (p-value > 0.8), providing data-driven insights to enhance lending decisions.
