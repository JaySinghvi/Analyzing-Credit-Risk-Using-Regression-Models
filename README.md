# Analyzing-Credit-Risk-Using-Regression-Models
1. Collaborated with a peer to analyze the Kaggle Credit Risk Dataset using R, evaluating key predictors of loan defaults.
2. Developed logistic regression and random forest models to forecast loan applicants' likelihood of default and identify significant predictors.
3. Conducted a comprehensive analysis of debtors' financial data and loan statuses to determine critical factors for creditor decision-making.
4. Identified home ownership, reason for taking the loan, loan amount, interest rate, loan percent income, and credit history length as the most significant predictors of loan defaults.
5. Discovered that having a prior default in oneâ€™s credit history is a very weak predictor, with a p-value exceeding 0.8.
